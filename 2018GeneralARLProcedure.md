# 2018 General ARL Procedure 

* We are responsible for questions 1, 2, and 4. 
* Question 1: Concerns titles 
* Question 2: Concerns volumes 
* Question 4: Concerns eBooks (specifically monographs) & note
*some overlap between Question 2 and Question 4*

Question 2 is the easiest question. It has specific parameters explained in the instructions going back to a time when the volume count was the major factor. In theory it's only interested in physical objects on a shelf. Includes: book, bound serials, bound periodicals and scores. And when your counting there are itypes, Uclid item type codes that match those formats. Later they began to include digital books and digital series and we have our own local way of counting those digital formats. There is a web search stored on a server for [this](data.libraries.uc.edu/qc/arl.html). It would be great to get a copy of this search query

With items: books, serials and score \
With titles: monographs, serials, scores, microforms, sound recording, video recordings, computer resources, maps and graphics \
And if you have the same title in 5 formats then count it five times; only for titles. \
Each query is format specific. And depending upon then number of hits it will time out and that's why we run in multiple time or batches. 
Here in GIT we want to record the actual text of the queries.
