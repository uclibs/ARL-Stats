Once again, trying to record nn umbrella procedure document for the whole ARL process

Required programs
PowerShell (or bash?)
Ruby

C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18
ARL annual questionnaire, Collection Stats (questions 1-4) 
	Q1 Titles (all formats)
	Q2 Vols. held (traditional definition of "vol")
	Q2 Footnotes ... Adjustments, and list of our 003 Collections
	Q4 EBooks

Bill wrote scripts to automate portions of the process; James wrote a Ruby script to compile the tally for question 1. Sean and I created the original postres queries from UCLID Saved Searches

Set up documents and spreadsheets;

List of folders containing various spreadsheets and documents from 17-18

C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18
	\ARL_17-18_Worksheet-Calculations.docx 
		Worksheet doc for Dan Q1 Titles, Q2 Vols. (and Footnote), Q4 Ebooks:

	\ARL_17-18_SpecCol_q1+q2.docx	
		Worksheet doc for Dan Special Collections Q1 and Q2:
		
	\Process_ARL11-12_Q1-Titles_Strategy.docx
	\ProcessDoc_15-16.txt
	\ProcessDoc_17-18.txt
		Instructions for local process
		

	\ARL_documents (folder) 
		\17arlstatistics fillable.pdf (also used for 17-18)
		\17instruct.pdf
		\17statisfaq.pdf
	
	\Calculation Spreadsheets (folder of spreadsheets)
		\arl17-18_Q1-2_Jeff's_Calculations.xlsx
		\arl17-18_SpecCol_totals.xlsx
		\Q2_footnote.xlsx
		\buar_archival_boxes.xlsx

Q1 Process: 
create separate folders by format, each folder includes 3 SQL (queries)
process the queries in PGAdmin (online) 
write results for each query to .csv files in respective format folder
use context "Git Bash Here" on folder, and ./Process.sh to produce "count.txt" files
	remember to remember to edit the write to line
	it's important to be consistent in csv naming conventions 

After running queries and process in all format folders, run (double click) "count_arl-q1.rb" to collect totals and write to "arl-tally.txt"
	line 5: "require date"   EDIT date in line 40
Add the info from "arl-tally" to Calculations spreadsheet
