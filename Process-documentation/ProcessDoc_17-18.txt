Once again, record a procedure document for the whole ARL Collection Stats process

As nearly as possible, run PostgreSQL queries in UCLID on July 1, or in the first week of July to provide a snapshot of the catalog at fiscal year’s end and eliminate the need to account for withdrawn or deleted records. 

Required programs
	PGAdmin (web)
	PowerShell (or bash?)
	Ruby

Documents and files for each annual reporting period (fiscal year) are stored in a shared folder. 
The folder for reporting period 2017-2018 is on [UC Box] 
[C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\ ]

ARL annual questionnaire, Collection Stats (questions 1-4).  Folder contains documents and subfolders as illustrated in the example below:
	
Bill wrote scripts to automate portions of the process; Bill (James?) wrote a Ruby script to compile the tally for question 1. Sean and I created the original postres queries from UCLID Saved Searches.
*** SET UP FOLDER STRUCTURE, FILES, SPREADSHEETS, AND DOCUMENTS. It is necessary to maintain consistency in structure and in naming conventions for the Postgres queries and the processing scripts to function accurately,  One method is to copy and paste from the preceding year's folder, renaming folders and contents as necessary. ***

Q1 Process:
C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\Q1
	see document "ARL Statistics - Question 1 procedure"

	
Q2 Process
C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\Q2
	The search for UL Q2 currently resides on http://data.libraries.uc.edu/qc/arl.html
	The query results include only Univ. Libs, UCBA, and Clermont
	
	for the text of the query see: \q2_all.sh
	
	Note: "Vols held" is defined in the ARL Survey Instructions. The query includes item record IType codes for print monographs, serials, scores, print materials bound with accompanying media, electronic monographs, and scores; electronic serials are excluded. 
	
	Save query results as <q2_yyyy-runMM-DD_results.txt>
	Copy and paste from <q2...results.txt> to "Q1-2_Jeff’s_Calculations" EXCEL Workbook, sheet 2 "yy-yy-q2 vols" 
	

Q2 Footnote
C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\Q2\003 Batch collections footnote
	\q2_footnote_17-18-003-ER+730-OCU-2.sql (requires multiple passes)
	
	download results to .csv or copy+paste to .xlsx
	\q2_footnote_17-18_003+730_mono_pass1.xlsx

	join output files, use uniq -c to count
	to prepare fo31otnote; 
	
	transfer info to Calculations spreadsheet
	C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\Calculation Spreadsheets/q2_footnote.xlsx
		follow pattern from previous year

	if the query is not run early in July, may need to adjust for "Pull and replace" collections


Q4 Process 
C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\Q4

	\arl_17-18_q4.sql

	\ebook_count.txt


Separate questionnaires for Special Collections. 
Q1 and Q2. 
For Q1, see
