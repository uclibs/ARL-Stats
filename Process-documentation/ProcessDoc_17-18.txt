Once again, record a procedure document for the whole ARL Collection Stats process

As nearly as possible, run PostgreSQL queries in UCLID on July 1, or in the first week of July to provide a snapshot of the catalog at fiscal year’s end and eliminate the need to account for withdrawn or deleted records. 

Required programs
	PGAdmin (web)
	PowerShell (or bash?)
	Ruby

Documents and files for each annual reporting period (fiscal year) are stored in a shared folder. 
The folder for reporting period 2017-2018 is on UC Box. 
C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\

ARL annual questionnaire, Collection Stats (questions 1-4) 
	Q1 Titles (all formats)
	Q2 Vols. held (traditional definition of "vol")
	Q2 Footnotes ... Adjustments, and list of our 003 Collections
	Q4 EBooks
	
Bill wrote scripts to automate portions of the process; Bill (James?) wrote a Ruby script to compile the tally for question 1. Sean and I created the original postres queries from UCLID Saved Searches.


Set up documents and spreadsheets; copy and rename docs and files from preceding year.

	join output files, use uniq -c to count
	to prepare fo31otnote; transfer info to Calculations spreadsheet
	C:\Users\crawfotj.AD\Box Sync\arl\17-18\Calculation Spreadsheets/q2_footnote.xlsx
		follow pattern from previous year

	if the query is not run early in July, may need to adjust for "Pull and replace" collections
