Special Collection survey folders do not have process-format subfolders folders, 
the process shell script used elsewhere could potentially dedup title strings between two different formats.

Instead, run sort+uniq  [sort -u [filename] |wc -l] on files? 
                                     (LC_ALL=C sort -i -u q1_set1* | wc -l)


more notes in cygwin tips.txt 
For the Special Collections, since most formats will require a single pass of set2 and set3, write the results file to same folder as the queries. 
For monographs, or any other that requires joining files, move .csv files to subfolder and join use "cat" 
$ cat *csv > q1_set2_buar_mono_catALL.csv

copy or move joined file to main folder, and on each .csv file
$ sort -u q1_set2_buar_mono_catAll.csv | wc -l

copy and paste output to BUAR_ARL_13-14_q1_count.txt
q1_set2_buar_mono_catAll.csv | wc -l 52163

52163	q1_set2_buar_mono_catAll.csv
